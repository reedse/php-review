# Data Structures - Junior Developer Interview Problems

Below are several common data structure problems that might appear in junior developer interviews. Try to solve them on your own before looking at the solutions.

## Arrays and Strings

### 1. Reverse a String
Write a function that reverses a string without using built-in reverse functions.

### 2. Find the Missing Number
Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.

### 3. Two Sum
Given an array of integers and a target value, determine if there are two integers in the array that add up to the target.

## Linked Lists

### 4. Detect a Cycle in a Linked List
Write a function that determines if a linked list has a cycle.

### 5. Find the Middle Element
Write a function to find the middle element of a singly linked list in one pass.

## Stacks and Queues

### 6. Valid Parentheses
Write a function that takes a string of parentheses and determines if the order of the parentheses is valid.

### 7. Implement a Queue Using Stacks
Implement a queue data structure using only stacks.

## Trees and Graphs

### 8. Check if a Binary Tree is Balanced
Write a function to determine if a binary tree is balanced (the depths of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than one).

### 9. Find the Lowest Common Ancestor
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

## Hash Tables

### 10. First Non-Repeating Character
Write a function that finds the first non-repeating character in a string.

## Additional Problems

### 11. Fibonacci Sequence
Write a function to generate the nth Fibonacci number.

### 12. Palindrome Check
Write a function to check if a given string is a palindrome.
